TripHappyCannabis/Dope Destinations

App that aims to increase ridership on the metro in Los Angeles county through incentivizing using the metro to travel to dispensaries. Given the recent change in laws that now allows recreational use of cannabis we would like to capitalize on the increase of tourist that typically occurs after such change in legislation. In addition, we would like to include locals who use the metro or who could potentionally take the metro as to avoid driving under the influence.
